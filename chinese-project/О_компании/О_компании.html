                        This allows the company to harvest large volumes of wood for production, while not depending on third-party suppliers and the situation in the primary market. Another advantage is that our company is able to process several types of wood products such as Pine, Larch, Siberian Pine, Fir, Spruce.
                        
                        At the "Kavalerovskij lesopromyshlennyj kombinat" DoK forestry bases, modern forestry equipment is used for harvesting wood that meets high international standards that cause the least possible damage to the environment, which also positively affects the cost of production. The company at the logging site annually carries out a wide range of measures for the protection, protection and reproduction of forests.
                        
                        In terms of forest reproduction, DoK LLC "Kavalerovskij lesopromyshlennyj kombinat" works to create forest crops and also contributes to the natural regeneration of forests, aimed at creating favorable conditions for successful forest regeneration.

After passing through the measuring module, the logs, in accordance with the developed program, are laid out in "pockets" and then transported in the warehouse of logs.

The board goes through several stages of processing, such as: removal of defects, subsequent splicing and gouging on Weining equipment. These operations are performed on two shops of the enterprise: DOTS 1 and DOTS 2.

                        In the same workshops glued beams are produced. For this operation, a press was purchased and successfully operates in conjunction with the board preparation line. Passing along this line, the board is covered with a layer of glue (photo above), folded in a pile and sent to the press, where the future beam is formed under the required pressure and temperature.

                        Wood pellets are a cylindrical extruded product from dried sawdust.
                        
                        The diameter of the pellets is 8 mm.
                        Length is from 10 to 40 mm.
                        Pellet density is 1.12 g / cm3
                        The calorific value is 4.6–5.2 MW / ton.
                        
                        Pellets are an environmentally friendly product. In the production of pellets no auxiliary adhesive additives are added; pellets are made from clean sawdust. To obtain a cylindrical shape the sawdust is dried and pressed in specialized machines.
